• Started the project.


## How to run:

First download the repository.

Type make to compile it.
To start the program it's:

`./push_swap "number 1" "number 2" "number 3" (...)`

For example:

`./push_swap 5 2 10 30 -2 0`

## Info:

In this project you have to make a sorting program using only two stacks.\
Easy to make it work, hard to make it follow the required instructions.

For 100 numbers, you need to have at least less than 1100 instructions.\
For 500 numbers, it's less than 8500.

Tried to do my own method, it worked but I couldn't get the required instructions.\
Tried a few other times, it was fast, but not enough.

[This method is the one used.](https://medium.com/@jamierobertdawson/push-swap-the-least-amount-of-moves-with-two-stacks-d1e76a71789a)

One other very important thing in this project was the use of Doubly Linked List.\
It improved the usage of Linked Lists vastly.
